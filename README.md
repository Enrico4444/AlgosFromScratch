# AlgosFromScratch

This repository was made for fun and personal interest in knowing the deep functioning of the most popular ML/DL algorithms. 
It includes algorithms developed by myself from scratch in Python Numpy all independently (credit for code snippets taken from the internet is always included).
These are mainly for personal learning purposes, but I hope they can be useful for who wants to understand how algorithms work rather than just how to apply them.
These are only the most basic versions of the algorithms, and are not intended for use in production, where in-built Python versions should be used.
Please leave any comment if you found these implementations useful or if you see anything that could be improved
